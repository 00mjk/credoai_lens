# Documentation & Website Generation

Building the docs requires additional dependencies listed in [`./requirements-dev.txt`](./requirements-dev.txt).

This directory contains the content relevant to documentation & website
generation using `sphinx`. The most important resource is `conf.py` which
includes settings and extensions that `sphinx` uses.

These docs make use of Sphinx's autosummary recursion.
To see how to configure Sphinx to do this, see this `Github repo README <https://github.com/JamesALeedham/Sphinx-Autosummary-Recursion>`_.
