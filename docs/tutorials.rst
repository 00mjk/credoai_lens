**Quickstart Demo**

Get started here. We will assess a payment default prediction model for gender fairness 
using Lens, in 5 minutes.

**Lens FAQ**

Lens has a number of functionalities. This notebook showcases them and shows how 
to achieve common tasks.

**Connecting with the Credo AI Governance App Demo**

Lens is primarily a framework for comprehensive assessment of AI models. However, it is also the 
primary way to integrate assessment analysis with 
`Credo AIâ€™s Governance App <https://www.credo.ai/product>`__. 
This tutorial walks you through the steps to set up the connection.

**Binary Classification Demo**

Lens can help you assess their performance and fairness of binary classification models. 
In this notebook, this capability is demonstrated on a scenario where binary classification is 
used to predict the likelihood that an applicant will default on a credit-card loan.

**Data Assessment Demo**

Biases in data could result in biased algorithmic outcomes. Lens can assess a structured 
dataset for biases. This notebook demonstrates this capability on an income dataset.

**Language Generation Demo**

Lens assess language generation models like GPT3 for bias, toxicity, etc. See how in this notebook.
