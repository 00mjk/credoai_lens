   Experimental Evaluators <./evaluators/experimental>

Evaluators are the classes that perform specific functions on 
a model and/or data. These can include assessing the model for fairness, or profiling a 
data. Evaluators are constantly being added to the framework, which creates Lens's standard
library. All evaluators can be found through the  :ref:`api documentation <api>`.
