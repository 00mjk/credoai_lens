    "## Overview\n",
    "Connecting with the Credo AI Governance Platform is straightforward using Lens. After following this tutorial you'll be up and running!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Find the code\n",

    "### Config File\n",
    "First, ensure you have a `config` file somewhere on your computer. The default location where Lens will look for it is `~/.credoconfig`. The structure of the config should look like this\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "TENANT={tenant name} # Example: credoai\n",
    "CREDO_URL=<your credo url>  # Example: https://api.credo.ai \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This config gives Lens API access to the Governance Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Connecting to a particular model, dataset, or AI Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Lens connects to the Governance Platform via a `CredoGovernance` object. This specifies the IDs of the AI Solution, model and data you want to associate your assessments with. The IDs are found in the url of your AI solution or model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the AI Solution ID is found here: `...credo.com/ai-solutions/{ai_solution_id}`\n",

    "## Using Lens\n",
    "\n",
    "This is going to be familiar if you've gone through our quickstart tutorial! The only addition is the use of a `CredoGovernance` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credo Governance Artifact\n",
    "The CredoGovernance object has a few functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The ability to get an alignment spec from the AI Solution (created during the aligned process). The alignment spec is either downloaded straight from the Governance Platform, or supplied as a json file for air gap deployment. This alignment spec can be supplemented (or overwritten) with an alignment spec you define in code and pass to Lens.\n",
    "* The ability to register models and projects.\n",
    "* Encoding the IDs of governance objects so Lens can easily export metrics and reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\** **Attention** \\**\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics and reports will _either_ be exported to the model and data specified in by `CredoGovernance` (using the `model_id` and `data_id` arguments) OR a new model and data will be registered on your CredoGovernance platform automatically, which will then be used for export.\n",
    "\n",
