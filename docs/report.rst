Reporting
==============
Lens is able to export a full report as a notebook or html. This notebook contains plots
and markdown cells describing the results for each assessment run on the CredoData and/or 
CredoModel passed to Lens. 

Lens achieves this visualization using a set of `Reporters`. These reporters handle
plotting and describing in plain-text the assessments. While the reporters can be used to display
plots in-line, their full functionality is in creating standalone reports.

The :ref:`quickstart tutorial <quickstart>` creates an example report, which we reproduce here.
Reports are able to be downloaded localled or sent directly to Credo AI's Governance Platform.
